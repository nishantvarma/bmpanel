src/theme.c:
	Probably 'theme_is_valid' isn't up-to-date. It should be refactored
	or even rewritten.

src/theme.{h,c}:
	I need a tiny version of theme parser to implement correct --list
	command.

src/bmpanel.c:
	Implement correct --list command: check dirs with themes for 'theme'
	file and parse it with tiny parser. Get name, author and version
	out of it.

*:
	Remove composite mode.

<unknown>:
	Write a manpage for bmpanel.

<unknown>:
	Write theme tutorial with nice images.

*:
	Xinerama support (multi-monitor configurations).

*:
	XRandR support (react on resolution changes).

src/bmpanel.c:
	Remove #ifdefs #endifs from sources. Use separate files.

src/bmpanel.c:
	XDG conformance (themes)

<unknown>:
	Drag'n'drop issue.
